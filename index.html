                    <h3>Renewed Motivation</h3>
                    <h6>Posted: May 17, 2022</h6>
                    <p>I recently completed the foundations section of 
                        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. The final project
                    was to build a calculator that would do basic arithmetic (add, subtract, divide, multiply).
                    I was expecting the project to take well over a week to complete but I ended up finishing
                    it in only four days. I felt so proud of myself for completing it so quickly and it 
                    made me realize just how much I've learned in just over a month.</p>
                    <p>After completing this project, I truly feel like I can do anything if I put my mind
                        to it. My confidence is at an all-time high. I went through a period about a week ago where
                        I felt like maybe I wasn't cut out for this industry, but now I feel much closer to actually
                        doing this full-time.</p>
                    <p>I still have a lot to learn. There is still a long road ahead, but I am incredibly excited
                        for what my future holds.

                    <h3>Adding to the Site</h3>
                    <h6>Posted: May 7, 2022</h6>
                    <p>Today I decided to take a break from studying to work on my own projects. This is good
                        practice and will help solidify what I've been learning. At this point, I'm nearly
                        done with the foundations section of 
                        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. Before I move on to the final project,
                        I wanted to read through the entire JavaScript portion to make sure I really have a firm grasp of
                        what I've learned so far. I'm taking the weekend off to give my brain a bit of a refresh.</p>
                    <p>I'm still really enjoying learning about web development, but I'd be lying if I said that my
                        motivation wasn't starting to wane a little. I can't help but feel a little overwhelmed by
                        all that I've been learning and I sometimes worry that I'm not progressing as quickly as I would
                        like. But, I was warned that this would happen. One of the first sections of TOP was all about
                        staying motivated. It, as well as several online articles on the subject, said that everyone who 
                        learns to code goes through the same journey. At first your motivation is really high, but as you progress
                        and realise how difficult it can actually be, you start to doubt if you're really cut out for it. The people
                        who are currently employed as software engineers or web developers are the ones who persevered and made it
                        through that dip. </p>
                    <p>If I ever feel like I'm not progressing at the rate that I would like to be, I have to remind myself
                        of how far I have come so far. A month ago, I knew nothing about web development. In that 
                        short time, I've managed to learn enough to build this website. Imagine what I'll know one month from now.

                    <h3>My First Blog Post</h3>
                    <h6>Posted: April 23, 2022</h6>
                    <p>Welcome to my first website! I recently started teaching myself web development through 
                        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project.</a> I started about a month ago 
                        and am progressing nicely. I'm starting this website as a journal of my progress that I can
                        look back on in the future to see how far I've come.</p>
                    <p>So far I've learned about HTML, which is used to build the basic structure of the website (adding
                        text, pictures, etc.) and CSS, which is used to style the website (changing colors, changing
                        fonts, and placing the text where you want it). In the last two days I started learning about
                        JavaScript which is used to make webpages interactive.</p>
                    <p>More to come soon...</p>
