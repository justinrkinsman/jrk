                <h6>Posted: April 23, 2022</h6>
                    <p>Welcome to my first website! I recently started teaching myself web development through 
                        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project.</a> I started about a month ago 
                        and am progressing nicely. I'm starting this website as a journal of my progress that I can
                        look back on in the future to see how far I've come.</p>
                    <p>So far I've learned about HTML, which is used to build the basic structure of the website (adding
                        text, pictures, etc.) and CSS, which is used to style the website (changing colors, changing
                        fonts, and placing the text where you want it). In the last two days I started learning about
                        JavaScript which is used to make webpages interactive.</p>
                    <p>More to come soon...</p>
